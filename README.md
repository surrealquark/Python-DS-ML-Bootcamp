# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.
