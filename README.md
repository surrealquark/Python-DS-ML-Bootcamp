# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# K Means Clustering
In this project, I used what we learned in class in order to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into Private and Public groups using an unsupervised learning algorithm. Even though this data set had lots of labels, they were not considered in the final results of the project and the classiciation report/confusion matrix don't make sense in a practical context because we were just trying to get an idea of how the algorithm performed using unsupervised learning. In order to perform this analysis I used the built-in dataset for the course in this particular chapter and followed the lecture material in order to better structure my code. This is a practice project for the course!
