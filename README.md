# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# Random Forest Project
In this project I analyzed publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). This bootcamp class taught me how to analyze lending data from 2007-2010 to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. I used the .csv file that the class materials had already provided because it was pre-cleaned of NA values. Based on what I learned around Decision Trees and Random Forest analysis, I trained a model and made some predictions and evaluation. The results of this analysis were pretty interesting, but the model needs to be improved because it wasn't super accurate. Please note that this was all based on what I learned in class, and specifically around the notes and materials from the course for this segment.
