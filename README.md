# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# PCA/General Factor Analysis of Cancer Data

Based on the class curriculum, I used the breast cancer dataset from Sci-Kit Learn for my analysis. The dataset had thirty numeric attributes about breast cancer tumors, used in order to build an analysis of what components are the most important ones that explain the most variance of this dataset. However, I did not use any Machine Learning algorithms to perform any prediction or classification, I just did a principal component analysis. The goal was to use PCA first to get an idea of as whether a tumor is malignant or benign. In this case, I used PCA to find the first two principal components. 

The components here correspond to combinations of the original features. The code includes a heatmap illustrating visually what the principal components represent. This one shows relationship between the correlation of the various features and the principal components themselves, the higher the number of the row is the more highly correlated it is with the columns.
