# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# K Nearest Neighbors with Python Project
In this project, the course materials provided a challenge where I was given a "classified" data set. The feature column names were hidden but I was given the data and the target classes. I tried to use KNN to create a model that directly predicted a class for a new data point based off of the features. The instructor hid the feature column names but did give me the data and the target classes. This project was included in the course materials, and the data used was provided by the course. However, I went through and wrote the code to make it work based on what we learned in the lectures and the reading materials attached in order to complete this project.

# Random Forest Project
In this project I analyzed publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). This bootcamp class taught me how to analyze lending data from 2007-2010 to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. I used the .csv file that the class materials had already provided because it was pre-cleaned of NA values. Based on what I learned around Decision Trees and Random Forest analysis, I trained a model and made some predictions and evaluation. The results of this analysis were pretty interesting, but the model needs to be improved because it wasn't super accurate. Please note that this was all based on what I learned in class, and specifically around the notes and materials from the course for this segment.

# Support Vector Machines Project
Based on the series of class lectures and course materials, I created an analysis of the Iris flower data set. This data set was used in order to train a model and evaluate this dataset by building a Support Vector Machine Classifier.
