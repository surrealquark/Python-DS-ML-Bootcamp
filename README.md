# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# Recommender System Project
Based on materials from the class and lectures, I created a content-based recommender system for a dataset of movies by using the Movie Lens dataset. In this project I focused on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item (movies). It will indicate which movies/items are most similar to an original movie choice. I heavily referenced course materials and notebooks for this project.
