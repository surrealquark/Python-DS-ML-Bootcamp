# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# Natural Language Processing Yelp Data

For this project I used the material taught in class in order to perform a combination of machine learning techniques to analyze the Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013). I attempt to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.
