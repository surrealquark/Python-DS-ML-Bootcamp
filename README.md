# Python-DS-ML-Bootcamp
The projects in this repo are based on Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)'s class "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp." Many of the data sets used and instruction for the code is provided by Jose Portilla for the class. The projects uploaded here were written by me, with instruction based on what we were learning in class.

# K Nearest Neighbors with Python Project
In this project, the course materials provided a challenge where I was given a "classified" data set. The feature column names were hidden but I was given the data and the target classes. I tried to use KNN to create a model that directly predicted a class for a new data point based off of the features. The instructor hid the feature column names but did give me the data and the target classes. This project was included in the course materials, and the data used was provided by the course. However, I went through and wrote the code to make it work based on what we learned in the lectures and the reading materials attached in order to complete this project.
